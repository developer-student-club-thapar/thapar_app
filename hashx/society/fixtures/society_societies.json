            "about": "Model United Nations, also known as Model UN, is an unmatched experience where various committees and organs of the United Nations (UN) are simulated and participants can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Thapar Model United Nations is one of the most prestigious MUN conferences in the country. With a legacy of 10 years, Thapar MUN Society prides itself in delivering an enriching experience of debate and dialogue in its 20 successful conferences. Backed with a proficient secretariat, the society offers a conference where the delegates gain an insight into the operations of the United Nations by actively participating in the resolution of critical global issues. In the course of an academic year, Thapar MUN Society conducts two MUN conferences: Thapar MUN Intra, which is confined to the students of Thapar Institute itself, providing the students with an introductory experience of a MUN, and Thapar MUN Inter, where students from all over the country participate and sharpen their debating, diplomacy, writing and artistic skills. The participation in a Model United Nations, specifically in Thapar Model United Nations is not circumscribed merely to debaters and diplomats. Thapar Model United Nations recognizes the participation in the form of reporters/press members, debaters, caricaturists and photographers, thus covering the entire spectrum of skills and interests that the participants might possess. Both the MUN conferences are preceded by training sessions/workshops wherein the students are equipped with the methodology of performing in a MUN by the most experienced and accomplished members of the secretariat. Thapar Model United Nations is the ultimate medium to prepare oneself for professional careers. It involves analysis and critical thinking which are imperative in the professional world. The members of the secretariat continuously strive to strategize the conferences in such a manner that the delegates embody the expertise in public speaking, research, writing and problem-solving skills. Thus, Thapar Model United Nations serves as the stepping stone towards professionalism, instilling social confidence in the students and preparing them for their career. While one might consider MUN as a demanding and serious activity, the secretariat of Thapar MUN helps the students to get engulfed by the very essence of a MUN, making it an enjoyable experience. Thapar MUN Society goes beyond the confinements and provides a blended experience of fun and learning. The fun sessions between the debates, interaction with students from all around often inevitably leads to friendly competitiveness near the end of the conference. Thapar Model United Nations is a delightful experience in itself, where the debates, deliberations and social interactions craft the overall persona of an individual. Thapar Model United Nations with an everlasting ideology of diplomacy with pragmatic opinions is continuously expanding its impacts to bring on the table the real crux of a MUN that engulfs the students in an extremely meaningful experience, leaving them with an insatiable desire for learning more."

We, at Thapar Toastmasters Club, cater good learners over good speakers because we firmly believe in learning and achieving together. This is one of the key aspects of the club, where amateur speakers enter and leave as professional public speakers, who can enthral audience with their eloquence. Our club is built upon the fundamental core values of integrity, respect, service and excellence. Toastmasters is a platform that gives you exactly what you want out of it. Following the norms of Toastmasters International, the club holds meetings on a weekly basis. Club members take up roles a week prior to the meeting through our club application (an android software). These roles include Toastmaster of the day (TMOD) who chairs the meeting, speakers who deliver speeches, evaluators, table topic masters and other auxiliary roles. Moreover, even in times like these when our lives are restricted to virtual windows, we’ve kept our spirits high and conducted more than fifteen successful online meetings. At Thapar Toastmasters, we have always strived to make sure that maximum number of people get to know what the organisation is all about and how Toastmasters helps them in becoming better world leaders. Therefore, every year, we hold Cogitation workshop for five days in the proem week, which has always proved to be a memorable experience both for our team and for the freshers. Through this, we’ve always been successful in providing fundamentals of public speaking and leadership to the budding speakers through our interactive and innovative activities. Hence, we’ve influenced our audience to take a step forward in their professional journey. Cogitation is filled with fun-filled and mind-boggling events and activities which help the freshers overcome their stage fright. Apart from the cogitation week, we hold a Showcase Meeting completely dedicated to freshers. The showcase meeting is designed with the objective of briefing the prospective members about how a Toastmasters club functions and how the club proceedings are carried out. The idea is to carry out a normal Toastmasters club meeting in front of a large audience of prospective members who would like to join the club. Speech contests are an important part of the Toastmasters educational program. They provide an opportunity for Toastmasters to gain speaking experience, as well as an opportunity for others in order for the Toastmasters to learn by observing proficient speakers. The International Speech and Table Topic Contest makes its way from the Club, Area, Division and District level to the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. Apart from the weekly meeting sand contests, club holds inter and intra institution events annually. Some of them being Toast Talks, Toast Tussle, Toast Trials etc. The sole motive to conduct these events is to provide a platform where young minds come together to explore, think and study real world problems. Toast Talks is an annual flagship competition, where aspiring young speakers from the entire college, as well as other clubs compete to be crowned as the ‘THE BEST PUBLIC SPEAKER’. The club issues an annual newsletter “The Communique” displaying annual achievements and nuances of the club. Founded six years ago, Thapar Toastmasters Club has come a long way, developing leaders. We envision ourselves to be committed to this goal and continue with the same."

We also proved our community outreach at the National level by finishing among the top six most viewed as well as most voted social media channels at Enactus National cup. We also brought laurels, as winners of E-Summit organized by IIT Roorkee and runners-up at the National Social summit. Here we present to you some of the projects that we have undertaken to make our nation a better version of itself. Paddy Waste Management- One of the largest projects undertaken by any student organization in the region, this project is focused to subdue the burning of paddy waste after harvest season in the states of Haryana as well as Punjab. Naritva- While the world has reached the second decade of the 21st century, women's menstrual hygiene continues to remain a taboo topic among most in our society. We aim to raise awareness in rural and urban communities about the significance of using Biodegradable Sanitation Pads, with the development and distribution of the same. Entracer- As the world fought hard to find ways to track and isolate infected people in the COVID times, we managed to come up with our own contact tracing system to ensure that the number of people that can be infected is to a minimum. We along with fellow team delta developed a device that can check an individual's vitals such as temperature while providing sanitization services to limit the spread of COVID on campus premises. Grameen- While farmers have suffered at the hands of the deadly virus, this project is focused to help farmers in the region shift to precision farming to reduce the money that they spend on fertilizers. Khadyan- Along with Grameen, khadyan is focused to help farmers to shift to organic farming by providing organic manure at a cheaper rate. All work and no fun isn't a good recipe for success. So, we organize a number of activities throughout the year. The Annual Diwali event, Deepotsav ’19, generated funds through selling Diyas. It featured an Open-Mic to attract the crowds. The Diyas and most materials were brought from local roadside sellers in Patiala. All the funds received were given back to the local selling community of Patiala. Pride week was a week-long cultural extravaganza organized by Enactus Thapar to mark the pride month, organized from 18th to 26th June. It marked a strong effort from us to open the conversation upon the still taboo topic of the LGBTQ+ community, as it featured talks, panel discussions from prominent members of the LGBTQ+ community with the support of NGOs and other Enactus from North India. Métier: The Case Study Competition was organized to to help students locked up in homes tackle with the new realities of self-isolation.

Some of our past sponsors include Coca-Cola, Swiggy, Nestle, Pizza-Hut, Keventors, Uncle Jacks and Burger king. Thapar Food Festival organises numerous events loaded with happiness and countless flavours. First in this list is Orientation which gives an insight into the Thapar Food Festival accompanied by a bunch of surprises. Following orientation there is Dine-Out. Dine-out is a tour which brings the authentic taste of the royal city on your platter. This unique event is especially for first-year students so that they can interact with their peers as well as know about the famous eateries of the city. Then the ultimate battle of Food takes place known as Man vs Food. It is a chance for all true foodies to show their eternal love for food and win the battle of food by eating most at renowned food joints of the city. For what can be better therapy than a healthy dose of unabashed humour? Food and comedy are the universal means of communication and we believe in bringing both together. For fulfilling this purpose Thapar Food Festival organises Food Comedy where you can get culinary tips from the chef itself. To hold the crown of a chef is no simple task. A Cook-Off challenge is also organised by Thapar Food Festival which tests the teams’ ability to become “Chefs for A Day”. The fun and excitement of the program is no doubt the biggest draw. Finally, the most awaited food event of the year arrives which is the Main day. 50+ food stalls packed with more than 200+ luscious dishes from all around the globe. Ranging from sweet to waffles to succulent kebabs, you can experience the magnificent blend of different flavour accompanied by great ambience and happiness. Some of our past achievements include creating a new Guinness World record. Thapar Food Festival in a grand association with Coca-cola made a successful attempt at breaking the Guinness World record of opening a maximum number of Coca-Cola cans. This was made possible because of a crowd of 2000 participants filled with enthusiasm to enter a book filled with renowned names. The \"exchange for a change\" campaign was another impactful initiative took by Thapar Food Festival with an aim to spread awareness amongst the students regarding environment protection. Under this campaign, we managed to collect more than 50K plastic bottles from different schools and colleges of Patiala. Thapar Food Festival gives you an opportunity to create tons of memories with your friends and guarantees you a true heavenly food experience."

MSC as a family, is on a journey to procure limitless glory & a bag full of memories. Our last session was full of extraordinary experiences and remarkable events as follows. It all started from the Techmeet where enthusiasts spoke about the field they were exploring at present and also shared their ideas and projects corresponding to it. The seniors shared their journey in college which turned out to be a great learning ordeal for everyone. MSC always witnessed and appreciated the willingness to learn. However, with an abundance of information out there, it can get tricky to comprehend new technology. Keeping that in mind , an ML workshop was conducted by Dr. P.S. Rana encircling the basics as well as project ideas. It was a fun , interactive session that provided a head start for people willing to explore ML. Game of codes was yet another fascinating event administered in multiple rounds. It was the perfect niche to learn and grow for coding enthusiasts. One of the biggest hit of the last session would undoubtedly be the Open source meet-up. It was graced by the presence of Aman Dhattarwal, a beloved YouTuber, speaker, and guide for thousands. The enthusiasm was beyond anyone could have anticipated and rightly so. It was incredibly informative and guided the students to make the best of their college life. An idea consisting of coding and logical reasoning resulted into the event named Sherlocked which had multiple rounds and challenged the participants in intriguing ways. Makeathon is undoubtedly one such event which everyone eagerly waits for. It’s a beautiful blend of innovation , creativity and skills. Multiple institutions participated and gave us the opportunity to witness all kinds of technologies .The winners did not only end up winning exciting prizes but also got an internship opportunity. The placement season facilitates the emergence of numerous questions regarding DSA and placement related queries in students. To answer them , a placement drive was conducted in collaboration with Coding Blocks where students figured out what was needed to grab a good placement. A React JS workshop was conducted to spread awareness about its utility and to encourage more enthusiasts to dwell in this field. Mr Tathagat Thaplival graciously conducted the workshop and witnessed over 1800 learners. Lastly , the event which was an amalgamation of trading , technology and logical aptitude stunned many with its uniqueness and creativity. Relating to the real world , Abhyudaya had numerous crisis situations and had corresponding questions to avert the disaster. It was a never seen before experience and won the hearts of many. With every event , we strive to be even more creative , innovative and efficient than ever before. It’s a family where people thrive off of ideas and learning. We’ve only grown with time and hope to conquer unconquerable heights in the future as well."

We focus on off-roading motorsport events, and we primarily design 4 wheeler, 1 seater off-road buggy for the same. Our vehicles are not primarily designed for racing, rather they are designed to endure the harshest of the conditions. We design our vehicles to have lightest possible weight, yet the strongest chassis. We carefully select and put in the best suspension and braking systems to smoothly drive on the off-road terrain. Having an effective powertrain system gives us the best power output. Which finally results in building a vehicle so tough and durable that it can withstand any possible conditions it may have to face, and triumph over it. Working with us not only makes a student technically sound and enhanced in practical engineering implementation; also act like a social bond for all those interested in the field of automotive industry, where we constantly educate each other, as a team, on the current and upcoming automotive technology trends, racing motorsports, and career skills through various media like social media and other digital platforms."

We will tackle themes such as Women Empowerment through Entrepreneurship and Corporate Leadership, Gender Sensitisation, Sanitation, Hygiene, the Gender Binary and many other relevant issues. Our club will conduct workshops and seminars regarding these subjects and issues in our college and in nearby schools. Meanwhile focusing on creating interactive and educational content to raise awareness, as well as in depth explanations of these aforementioned topics and analyses of policies regarding the same.

Clubs in Delhi have partnered with the local police to conduct self defence workshops in government primary schools, this is an idea we also want to do. Sanitation and Hygiene/ Good Touch Bad Touch/ Domestic Violence etc workshops to be conducted in as many primary schools as we can reach out to.

Many of us had also started travelling after watching movies like Yeh Jawaani Hai Dewaani, Zindagi na Milegi Dobara, Dil Chahta Hai etc. Thapar Adventure Club is a platform for travel enthusiasts and those who love Adventure. Our aim is to promote travelling and conduct adventure activities for the students of our Institute. The prime focus of the society is trekking, hiking, climbing, and trips to the different regions of India and to encourage every travel enthusiast. The club organizes treks (only for club members) in the Himachal and Uttarakhand regions, catering to the travel amateurs as well as professionals. Along with treks, trips are also organized in different states of India. We’ve organized many trips to Udaipur, Manali, Tirthan Valley, Bir billing, Jaisalmer, Rishikesh and treks of easy-moderate level. The club aims to inspire students to go beyond their perceived limits, develop self-reliance, self-discipline, and teamwork. Activities like trekking, camping, rock climbing that focus on nurturing the ability to plan, organize and take decisions, and foster time management and problem-solving are organised regularly. Here in Adventure Club, you learn from scratch on how to plan any trip for a given number of people. The best thing about Adventure Club is that we do not have formalities. We do not greet our seniors as ‘Sir/Mam’. We share our slightest of feelings because we know that nobody will judge here. We do not have a lot of work pressure so that our studies remain unaffected. We do not organise a lot of meetings like other societies to hamper your time. PERKS of being in our Club: 1. The treks are planned only for the members of our Club. 2. The trips also have a limited number of seats. Although trips are open for all, the priority is given to the Club members. 3. The Adventure Club collaborates with the Indian Institute of Skiing & Mountaineering (IISM), Gulmarg. We provide you with the opportunity to do a Basic Skiing Course in Gulmarg(Kashmir) or Auli(Uttarakhand). 4. You get to know a lot of fellow travellers and you can plan an unofficial trip with them. 5. We have a party after every successful trip and an annual party to give a farewell to our seniors. Well, to be frank, all our trips/treks are not less than any party. 6. The cost of our treks/trips is a lot cheaper (roughly 50%) than other Organisations. 7. There is no other society which plans and executes trips and treks. In the end, College life is not just about books but also for making memories for life. The trips and adventure with your squad are dreams for most of the teenagers.

            "about": "\"Talk is cheap, show me the code.\" - Linus Torvalds( Creator of Linux Kernel) Today is the age of computer science. It is the age of creators and developers, people with real-life problem-solving skills, and people who want their works to affect the lives of millions and billions. With the advent of this new age, the senile custom of learning theoretically and waiting for a chance to apply, which never comes, needs to change. After learning or exploring a particular skill set, the next most challenging job is finding great projects on that technology stack, something that shines on your resume. Because at the end of 4 years here at college, that is what's going to matter. Break the wheel and become a part of something worth investing your time in. Get equipped with the skills that will help you be ahead of others in the industry. Do projects that will make your resume outshine. Become the part of a society that believes in collaboration and growing together. We don’t work to impress, we work to express, we don’t work to show the college how good a society it is , but we work for the family, the society itself ,what all can we do for anyone who is a part of it. We focus our energies and resources on the things worth investing in. With round the year on-going industry level projects, guest lectures, some of the best-organized competitions, and brilliant alumni, LUG stands out from this plethora of monotonic societal culture here in Thapar. With a fantastic set of mentors who know what they are doing, you get access to one of the most select groups of people you can reach out to for guidance. Don't limit yourself to the pit of course-doers instead get to apply that knowledge to build something different, something that will impact the lives of people. Since LUG is a collaborative community spread worldwide, get a chance to network with people from various places and fields. With us, there is no more roaming around aimlessly and no more beating around the bush. Become an essential part of something great.So it's time guys, the society is again opening its hands to anyone who wants to be a part of it, to anyone who can show his worth ,dedication and will to be anonymous but still the greatest. And I think that's only how a society is created, it's not created for the benefit of masses but for the benefit of the people who put in their efforts for the society."

            "about": "Thirty years ago, the potentially disruptive impact of heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels and rain forests became front-page news. In the time it took to build the case that climate change is a pollution problem, it’s become unnervingly more than that. Coming back to 2020, climate change is still an insidious problem that fails to be taken seriously. Zooming in, even more, coming to the local level, because that's how it matters and that's how it needs to be addressed, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala prides itself over a lush green campus which is the legacy the Paryavaran Welfare Society aims to constantly create. Paryavaran Welfare Society is the perfect place to start working towards the environment, give it what it has always sought and deserved, care, and love. We are a Non Profit Society that aims to take up the issues of the environment and address them in our own small yet profoundly powerful way. The environment needs all the help and care it can get, so do we, but we also promise a newfound skill set that includes overcoming your social fears and realizing that tending to the GREEN doesn't make you any less. We conduct plenty of events throughout the academic year, ranging from Plantations, Vehicular Pollution Check camps, Cleanliness Drives, Annual Diwali event to our annual flagship event Econigma which has enjoyed a lot of success in recent years. We are a low effort society and would never ask our members to prioritize the society over their academics. Our events promise to magically vanish your social fears, stage fear, and responsibility phobia. Last year, we went out and planted 500 trees on campus, which had never been done before. Our 'fresher' members get to be called the Executive Members of the society under the constant guidance of their seniors on the Core team. Responsibility is gradually handed over to the executive members after they have seen and learned from their seniors what it takes. The thing we pride ourselves on the most is that we are not just a society, we are a family that nurtures and cares for each other. The legacy our seniors left behind is picked up by the successors and multiplied several folds. We remain as tightly knitted as the roots of the strongest trees on campus and beyond. So, apply now and become a part of a society that cares for things beyond just ourselves but the members end up learning a plethora of skills and confidence that will remain with you for the rest of your life."

Literature shows the design of the creative process, allowing us to interpret the deep motivations of human minds and societies—both in the past and today. As one of the founding societies in Thapar University, we’ve had a long journey, and a legacy of people behind us who have not only shaped the society to what it is today but, also have given us a path to continue and better upon. <em>We at the core are a community of people passionate about Literature and Arts</em>, <em>piloted by</em> an eclectic notion of avant-garde ideas. As a group, we aim to bring together students from multiple disciplines with an interest in Literature, Cognitive Thinking, Discourse and Performing Arts, reflecting the interests of undergraduates, graduate, and associate members alike. For that we hold special events such as readathons, talks, screenings, shows, literature in performing arts, the fine arts, the social sciences, politics, and culture.</li> </ol> <p>Literary Society at Thapar is the amalgamation of 8 sub-socs, namely:</p> <ol> <li>Muse</li> <li>Poetsoc</li> <li>Debsoc</li> <li>Quizzing Club</li> <li>Theatre Club</li> <li>Cineastes</li> <li>Anubhooti</li> <li>Punjabi Literature</li> </ol> <p> <strong>2.

I’m kidding, we’re all into astronomy and astrophysics, and our hearts throb with passion when we look up. Talking about parallel universes, do you think they exist? If they do, what do you think they’d be like? A multiverse where each instance is unique and in a way, similar as well. Different versions of the same you spanning across an array of infinite universes. Hold on a second, did we just assume that life is omnipresent. Maybe it is not, maybe, it is really scarce and maybe, just hear me out, maybe it is only present in this one. The mere feeling of imagining such an existence can be a fun way to spend your lectures in college, however horrifying it may be. “Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life’s coming attractions”. The guy who said that later came to be known as one of the most important scientists of all time, not because of the quote obviously, but for discovering the photoelectric effect which forms the basis of solar energy which is leading the idea for a sustainable world. Developments in the field of astronomy affect our daily lives a lot more than we usually realize. And we’re more than just insightful group discussions. In the odd semester, we have our college oriented event- ‘Eureka’, with professors from renowned institutions telling us about Black holes, X-ray telescopes, special relativity and magnetic universe. Believe me when I say, these lectures are not something you’d want to miss. Sometimes, we’d go on industrial trips to SCL, Mohali or the ARIES observatory or on a failed night-out to spot a few shooting stars during a meteor shower(IN THE MIDDLE OF EST’S). And in the even semester, we organize space-games, quizzes, and other competitions for our college mates as well as the school students of Patiala in ‘Aakash-Ganga’, which usually spans over a couple of days. The aim is to spread the love for astronomy and space, among our members and the broader sections of the society. Afterall, life’s meaning eventually narrows down to the people around us. And that’s something we’re really proud of, that our members come from diverse branches, from electronics, to biomedical; from 1st years to the alumni who’ve left us 2 years ago and are still connected to us. And lastly, we go on a stargazing trip to some remote hill station with a hope to catch a glimpse of the beautiful and the glorious starry night that our ancestors were used to seeing almost every day. Only if there was a parallel universe where metropolitan cities had no light pollution. *sighs* I wish. Coming back to parallel universes, if they do exist, there must be one instance where you’d become a part of TAAS. Or do you think it’s this one? Then what are you waiting for? https://linktr.ee/taas"

Since then we have been igniting a spark in students to set new benchmarks in the technical, professional, and various multidisciplinary domains, and have never looked back till date. To add emphasis to the purpose we were serving and hence to add oil to the spark we ignited, we commenced our 'mentor-learner' program, which endeavored to help each other exchange ideas and skills, further helping us to reciprocate and grow together. We hence stood by and justified the abbreviation of what LEAD stands for. Learn.Emerge.Aspire.Discover. Ascertaining to our aim, we have always been embedding our best, to come up with the mentor-learner program and taking into consideration domains that vary from technical to designing, from research to innovation, from non-technical disciplines involving Resume building to personality development hacks to emphasis on topics like preparation for interviews and which preferences to make. Our members have conquered their concerned departments by Emerging as true Leaders. Our team has been Aspiring each day to accomplish new advancements and to make a difference. Furthermore, we discover new ideas that can transform the professionally, technically, and digitally to as much extent as possible. Still, we consider our journey as incomplete until we authenticate ourselves as first thought for any student who is looking for a competent mentor. We are progressing towards our aim every day, are you? Join us on this exciting journey. Be it robotics, web development, app development, mathematics, anything in your learning bucket.

We collectively teach underprivileged children from various schools in Patiala and those of fourth-class employees at TIET. Classes are held every day so that they can absorb maximum knowledge from our volunteers. We teach kids from classes 1-12 and diploma classes. We also teach different software skills to workers under our Adult Education Program with the aim to uplift them. The children are provided with various resources such as books, stationary etc. Along with education, many fun events are also held from time to time. In view of COVID-19 situation, we are teaching online. Pratigya Abhiyan aims to create joyous, meaningful memories and give them enough exposure. We are not just a team, we are a family of hard working and dedicated people, bound by a common noble cause. Being a very empathetic society at its core, all the members help the children selflessly through any problems that they face. This helps in the overall development of children as well as the volunteers. Events throughout the year develop the volunteer’s management, social and problem-solving skills. Co-curricular activities are instrumental for drawing out the child’s best potential. So, we organize diverse events such as art and dance competitions, sports day etc. from time to time to encourage them to come out of their shells. UDAAN is our flagship annual event. We invite parents to see their children perform in plays, dances and music on stage after a few weeks of practice. Our other events include Movie Eve, Kite Flying etc. This Abhiyan is an effort towards eradicating illiteracy and ultimately poverty in the society as a whole. We strive to nurture the dreams and minds of the future generations of this country. Volunteering is not just a simple word; it requires a lot of action too. We welcome you to take a step and be a part of the change we aspire to bring in the society. Serve the under-served, so that they find themselves in a better world."

Judges enjoy the event as they critique it and are honored with mementos. VIRSA MELA: Then comes our flagship event the “Virsa Mela” which lets you enjoy what a traditional fair is to the core. It offers you a number of stalls, dances like Malwai gidha, bhangra, etc, Punjabi Dhaba food to relish and enjoy. There are stunts, creative cultural photo booths, etc to watch. It is an evening full of vigor yet sophistication when everyone enjoys being in their cultural attire. GURPURAB: The ecstatic journey comes to an end with seeking the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji on his Prakash Gurpurab. Esteemed Ragis leave everyone spellbound with the melodious intoning of hymns, followed by Guru Ka Langar. VIRSA tries to serve as an open platform where students can exhibit and polish their non-technical, technical, and creative capabilities. Students get divided into various departments like creativity, content, design, marketing, etc. Each department works according to its purpose and gives the students an experience to grab all the opportunities the world offers. Along the journey, many members develop new capabilities and discover new talents amongst themselves. To commemorate our long lost culture, we not only believe in keeping our traditions in practice but in reinforcing all our Gurus’ teachings in our lives once again. With the determination and courage that all our warriors have displayed, we aim at working towards a drug-free and alcohol-free society. We aim at eradicating all the evils which weaken our society and our glorious culture. Our driving force for the future will be the will to prevent the youth from falling on the wrong track of alcohol, drugs, violence, etc. The modernity of yesterday is the tradition of today and the modernity of today will be the tradition of tomorrow and we want to leave no stone unturned to give modernity and culture worth remembering and gratifying."

We can build new children(robots) who are more suited for the new conditions. We are the robotics club of Thapar Institute, comprising students from Mechatronics, Mechanical, Electronics, Electrical, and Computer Science streams focused at developing our skills and contributing to robotics culture in T.I.E.T, Patiala. We aim to be the supporting hand for beginners and launchpad for the ˈwänəbē (adj.) experts, the fly high robotics and automation enthusiasts. Common interest driven intra-college community sharing resources for common gains. We primarily work on technologies like, but not limited to, Microcontrollers, CAD Modelling, Gazebo simulation, ROS, Power electronics, Raspberry pi. Weekly meetings are held to assess and discuss each other’s progress or discuss an ongoing project. We also work on multiple platforms (like Windows, Linux). Members conduct workshops to impart all this knowledge to the best of their expertise. So you have the opportunity to grow in multiple fields which gives you an enormous knowledge base while being expert in one. Our focus is not just on imparting technical knowledge but also to cultivate you to innovate and step up the game. Here you not only have the opportunity to work in a team composed of like minded peers, but also to lead them. Working individually on a multidisciplinary field like robotics is a very inefficient and time consuming work, hence a team of people working on different fields of engineering is necessary to make a robotics project possible. Good alumni network also ensures guidance in reference to the current industry. So here at MARS we await all who want to grow and lead into the future."
